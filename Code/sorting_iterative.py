  ### Logic: This has to make sure that all the items in the array are in
  ###        sorted order
  #####################
  ### Approach: Make it go from the start to the end, while it does that
  ###           it has to compare the previous with the next value and keep
  ###           going until it's false or everything is sorted
  #####################
  ### Process: 1. Make a variable
  ###          2. The items in position 
  # position = 0
  # while items[position] < items[position + 1]:

  ### Logic: I want to get my items sorted and I don't care how long it takes.
  ###        So I will check continous elements and if the one in a higher 
  ###        position is lower than the one in the next position change them, 
  ###        until order reigns.
